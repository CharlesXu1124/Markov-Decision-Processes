Implementation Instructions:

For Collision Avoidance 2D, simply pull the code to
local drive, and run "python collision_avoidance_mdp.py"

For MDP_blind_chess, pull the code to local drive, install Python 3.6.4, Keras,
Tensorflow in Anaconda, and run belief_state_training.py under Anaconda environment

For Autonomous Drone, remotely SSH to the coprocessor, navigate to the folder, and
run "python flight.py" for take-off
